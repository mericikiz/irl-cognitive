''' DESCRIPTION IMPLEMENTATION
Max Entropy IRL Algorithm is described in paper by Ziebert et al. (2008)
and a similar implementation is given in this Jupyter notebook: https://nbviewer.org/github/qzed/irl-maxent/blob/master/notebooks/maxent.ipynb

Algorithm implemented here is modified to account for:
- different environments
- multiple reward functions per environment
- multiple state features
- reward functions containing uncertainty
- an expert agent with cognitive parameters representing risk behaviour and biases in presence of uncertainty
